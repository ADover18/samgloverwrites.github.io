contact a second too long, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leave some Sybillean symbol dusted into your coffee with arcane minerals</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">obscene conjugal intimations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even common conversation was pickled in the sensuality of doom. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we walked around as deathly and as gauntly alluring as a young man at his first conquest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there was no longer anything to win, nor gain. there were simply moments containing, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">like reflections in a soap bubble, entireties and totalities, the sum measures of lives, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as fragile as the sum measures of lives,

curdle, that the hour was approaching. beads of anxious sweat began to percolate under Time&#39;s arm-pit; it occurred to me it had been a while since I&#39;d been to the beach. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">the day was limpid, sunless and limp dick</span><span class="c3">, and when the sun broke, it did so like a well timed joke, and still the grey remained, like a ground to its figure.</span><span class="c3 c9">- see through it like pond scum. jaundiced and taught under the ceremonial sheets. it was the grey of hangovers, of clocking on, the grey which accompanies the breaking of bad news like good china in the front room. it was the grey which announces the day but relinquishes the promise of night - the events of day hidden from the sun. it was the barbarity of things which must be and always will, laws which slide through bone like pistons, and abolish thought. it was a grey for looking into the cross-section of a breathing machine, and asking questions</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">the streets were empty. now and again a dog with no owner would emerge from an alley, cut diagonally by sunlight. it would look up and down the intersection and disappear once again into the shade. it was an unkind warmth that took more than it gave that beat me down that day, and the low dying light cut ribbons of light across the streets. concrete turned to green turned into sand, I sank a little more into the earth with each grade.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;now</span><span class="c3 c9">&nbsp;the sun was ripening </span><span class="c3">into the creme of time bleached and peeling wallpaper, </span><span class="c3 c9">but the sand was still hot under me. I took off my shoes. there was no one else around, but I wondered what I&#39;d say to one if one lay down beside me in the sand. by this time, I hadn&#39;t spoken to another human being in around three months, </span><span class="c3">and yet</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;even the most complex and depraved of intimacies would have seemed natural. life&#39;s playing field had been levelled, and even the subs on the bench were walking the pitch with whistles. when time is done and the buildings fall, the exclusionary logics fall with them. if I&#39;d have seen someone I&#39;d have sooner thought them myself than someone else - that&#39;s how long it&#39;s been. no uniforms, no markings. I would have welcomed another to myself like a necessary limb. I looked up and down the beach, and there was no one. and sitting down on the dry, as the tide rose, and the sky closed the sun, and the pathetic fallacies of better poets began to lour like a scowling, matronly face up above, I placed my hand down in the sand, and found the death conch spiral, and placed it to my perverted ear. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p

class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sitting, alone, smoking, thinking, in my private car, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the wheels would eat up the tracks and time would stop </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because I was not moving with it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was simply riding it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all the while you sit inside of thoughts of what you are, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you are still, objectively, someone</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who can only change </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if thoughts are committed to action. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but when I became motive upon time and moved with it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realised that to become means to die </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and to always be dying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and somehow that shocked me to lucidity. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because a little part of me </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the deathly part </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had wished to live forever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(that is what it means to live forever, to be already dead, as to be truly alive is to challenge death knowing that one will lose) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wished to live forever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and when I chose death and gambled my life and become alive in so doing, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I burnt the moorings to what I supposed I was, and, through doing, became at once what I am and must be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stricken, not with the bellicose, erratic maudlin sobbing of a drunk</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but with a sober, dry eyed melancholy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw truly</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">truly, now </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that I would die, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and there was no longer talking about it or fooling about it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realised it, fully, in all of its dimensions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been trying, in bad faith, to attain this realisation for a long, long time, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been going about it entirely the wrong way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it was something of value, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insofar as it was an eternal truth, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and valued it because, in my bad faith </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I valued only what was eternal, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and outside the laws of life and death</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as if contemplating the laws of life and death precisely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would render me exempt from them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">now I realise that value is only conferred upon mortal things</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and that mortal matters are the only true matters. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew this</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">completely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">as I stood with you</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">on the waters of a nothing place, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the nothing time after one clocks out or there is a drink to be had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it is always in these interstitial spaces, in which nothingness intersects with endlessness</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and these two merge in the commonplace tragedy of the renewal which deceives, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mirror one perceives in smoke; nostalgia. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time which smothers itself in the dime store scent of its own perpetual death</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fading on old sheets. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that is to say nothing of the only true fact, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">that as your li</span><span class="c3">fe</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;flowed in mine I felt a love which words do less than honour</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they shame it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and so a word </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if it is judicious,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">is only a grasping doomed to fail </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">is only a grasping at precious metals in the dark </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which greed greases and dooms the hold </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and so a word must acknowledge at all stages its death </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as I did when death, love, and the quiet mercy of silent company </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rebounded through the hills which have ensnared me </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and which no work of man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or totem to industry</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which no pylon can rob me of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the grand destroying majestic

them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then all masks fall and words fail </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and once again </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there is only ever
