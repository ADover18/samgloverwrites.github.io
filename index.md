**Welcome to the Garbage Pit**

I've got a bunch of writing which, thus far, has exclusively occupied the e-mail inboxes of my closest associates. While they are, without question, a dedicated readership, they are rather an exclusive one. Thus, in the interests of sending the good word a little farther afield, I'm gonna throw it on here. If you've happened upon this page, it's probably because I've accosted you drunkenly in a pub and written down the URL. If you've made it this far, I must have been at least moderately charming. You must have caught me in between drinks one and two. That's when I'm at my best. Linked conveniently below are some examples of my work. Some of it, I am unashamed to say, was written between drinks three and four, but most of it occured in the sweet spot, where from the right angle, the street through the smoke dripping venetians looks a little less like a horror, and a little more like something worth sweeping. 

As a disclaimer, at present the formatting of each text looks perfect on a desktop, but if you're reading on a mobile phone, it resembles my wildest nightmares, which revolve entirely around improper line breaks. 

Peace be upon you, and have a lucky day xoxo
