**Welcome to the Garbage Pit**

I've got a bunch of writing which, thus far, has exclusively occupied the e-mail inboxes of my closest associates. That's about three or four human beings. A dedicated readership, yes, but an extensive one, no. Thus, in the interests of disseminating it a little farther afield, I'm gonna throw it on here. If you've happened upon this page, it's probably because I've accosted you drunkenly in a pub and written down the URL. Well done, you've made it this far. And perhaps, much akin to Red in the vinegar strokes of Shawshank Redemption, you're willing to go a little further. There's a bunch of poems, short stories, and other fancies around here, (check under that volcanic rock). And they all lead, in a roundabout way, to a sun-kissed and victorious Tim Robbins, awaiting your company in the Garbage Pit. 

Cheers, love and hugs, and see ya soon xoxox
