class="c176"><p class="c244"><span class="c132">THE BLACK AND BLUES BOOK</span></p><p class="c72 c158"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c13 c220"><span class="c35">It was said even Charlie, Dan, and the rest of them fell prey to the black and blues So and so had gone up north, </span></p><p class="c41 c65"><span class="c35">and no one could get a hold of grass, though there was coke in every public bathroom from Glasgow to Shetland. </span></p><p class="c234"><span class="c35">No one had the time for even coffee or for a half of whatever, any longer. </span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c35">A certain thickening of the blood and of the air was observed as light bent out of shape, it did not seem to move as it was once want to, some years ago. </span></p><p class="c188"><span class="c35">That who-did-you-know got concrete feet, and when I wished upon a teevee satellite some evening, a quarter to witching hour, I was answered the following morning by a jovial JML presenter, who, propped upon my television stand, announced candidly it might never happen, but when it did, it would happen sort of sideways, and I wouldn&#39;t know the difference anyway. </span></p><p class="c184"><span class="c35">There were whisperings and malingerings around known locations, much like whispers while the walls crawl. And when they quit the crawling, they slowed to a stop, rolled into the by-lane and the engine cut, then nothing but red glare of hazards in the middle of the night. </span></p><p class="c93"><span class="c35">There were no places called home any longer, for anyone, and we all sort of slid by one another and tipped our caps. And goddamn you if you didn&#39;t know the handshake because we know now, you were never one of us. Our legs got stripped of all fat and nothing but sinew, nothing but muscle on us, and a thin coat for the winter, because we were all on our minimum wage feet, all the time. And you could say nothing to us which could offend. </span></p><p class="c146"><span class="c35">And you could do nothing to us that would hurt. </span></p><p class="c91"><span class="c35">And there was very little to account for in the bank. </span></p><p class="c15 c156"><span class="c35">And sometimes you would turn around and look to find another week or month had passed by too quick to see, you&#39;d been living so fast, so fast you were living a second at a time, splitting moments into their constituent parts like atoms. </span></p><p class="c173"><span class="c35">Well, </span></p><p class="c165"><span class="c35">it was around the time all this was happening that some guy figured he&#39;d talk about himself for a minute. To say we were friends would say too much or too little, but we dug each-other&#39;s minds in the strange way you sometimes happen to do. We&#39;d known each-other by face - though not name - when, one chill November afternoon, I found him passed out in a bar stool with a notebook in his </span></p><p class="c104"><span class="c35">hand. My attempts to make meaningful contact went unnoticed, as he was frightfully pissed. We hadn&#39;t seen each-other in some years though, and I was interested in where he&#39;d been; the murder squads had wiped out most of the undesirables and the creatives some years ago. Not that I need to remind you, but we inhabit more enlightened times now, don&#39;t we? </span></p><p class="c127"><span class="c35">In any case, with the possibility for conversation minimal, I took the notebook from his hands and read what he had to say. While I didn&#39;t find much in particular you might call likeable, it resonated with me the way certain sounds do, like a far-off train. I was still sitting next to him, reading, when he awoke some hours later, the bar festooned with empty schooners, and myself rather the worse for wear. After he had hurriedly reclaimed the text, he and I traded battle scars and raps, and we continued to meet on irregular occasions throughout the remaining years of his life. The conversations we had, though I never truly appreciated them at the time, rank amongst the most intriguing I&#39;ve enjoyed in the quiet years since my retreat from the scene. </span></p><p class="c63 c88"><span class="c35">Despite the candour we enjoyed in these meetings, one subject we never discussed was the notebook I&#39;d read that day in the bar. I suppose much of it expounded on experiences too particular to him to be of much interest to anyone else. Despite the literary ambitions of his younger, less inebriated years, I think that by the time of writing, writing itself had become for him more of an evacuation, and an emptiness, than a means of communication. That said, there was always something in him</span></p><p class="c20 c201"><span class="c35">which seemed to spite this, a voice that wanted thrown in with other people&#39;s, and this trace element, I expect, is what resonated within me all those years ago. A sort of ghost in the shell. </span></p><p class="c207"><span class="c35">The manuscript to which I refer, and which I here preface, bore more resemblance to an extended face-book post than a work of literary significance (or otherwise). Regardless, I couldn&#39;t help but find a certain quality in what he said, haggard and dissolute though it may be. I suppose that says more about myself and he, the times we lived through, than it does about the work itself. But now </span></p><p class="c186"><span class="c35">that he&#39;s gone wherever people go, and has taken the tonsure one last time, before one last walk down that narrow road, I thought I might post his narcissistic rag and see if anyone felt the same as I did - as I still do - about what he wrote. </span></p><p class="c178"><span class="c35">Anyway, here he is, in his own words; singing drunk in the shower, tripping over skips in the vinyl, whilst, high, the world rolls by, or even, yes, perhaps even stops for him - now and again.</span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c43 c121"><span class="c2">_______________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c43 c121"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll sleep tonight. it&#39;s october and I haven&#39;t washed in a week, and september or yesterday seems dead and gone and about nearly forgotten. I remember I was supposed to be writing something, but I left all my shit in the wrong place, someplace I can&#39;t go back to. thoughts half formed and thrown up on cocktail napkins, supermarket receipts, the backs of hands. perhaps I may fix to go back there and collect them. &quot;perhaps&quot; is fast becoming the salient term in my vocabulary. it is the fugue in my process of indecision, which weighs the options in each hand, somehow forgets what it&#39;s doing before a choice is made, and instead shits in the kitchen sink. I need somewhere to sleep tonight, but I don&#39;t know where. hot water and a hand-job, or some other superfluous grace note of hospitality to distract me from futile humanism. there are cars slashed burning on the black. the nights are drawing in, so gather your wits up with your skirts and hope. not for something fucking stupid, like world peace or equality; hope for a clean pillow slip, a lamp-shade, slippers, for the sound sugar makes as it sinks into tea. societies aren&#39;t built with ideals, but with bricks and glucose. </span></p><p class="c9 c105"><span class="c2">no men on the moon, then, no tomorrows. only singular exhalations of smoke into the ether, water vapour cast up by the shower, coiling in a sun-beam. singular frames, atoms of material reality. inhabiting these images, remaining attentive to the fact that you are always closer to now than to later, because &quot;now&quot; is something you can touch. you can throw &quot;now&quot; down onto a bed and acquaint yourself with it. &quot;later&quot; and &quot;before&quot; are twins that promise sacred displays of tribadism and deliver only glances and excuses. </span></p><p class="c9 c126"><span class="c2">I ought to have mentioned, but I&#39;m in love. my luck is running thin lately. we&#39;re sitting on this bus to somewhere and I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll sleep tonight, and I&#39;m in love. I guess it would be easier if she wasn&#39;t, but her luck must be fucked as well, so now we&#39;re fucked together. a friend of mine once said it was advisable to have a sense of humour about these things, but seeing how humourless he looked when he said it, I considered it irony. I was right, but wasn&#39;t acquainted with the brand. it&#39;s the kind like a guy who ties the knot for his own noose sort of a thing. if you find that funny you tend not to laugh out loud about it. I guess now I&#39;m in on the joke, rather than just trying to explain it, and so I can join that long procession of men (you remember that jacques brel song, &quot;next&quot;?) who step up to the trapdoor willingly, just to feel a pair of arms around their neck. </span></p><p class="c224"><span class="c2">so what then? 2 adults, 1 room? I hear howling wolf on the harp or any number of sounds I have not the ethnic lineage to adduce. but I know something of the black and blues when we step off the bus (which I wish I could call a greyhound, just for the way it sounds) - we step off the bus, and stand around while all the rest file off behind us. each and every one of them has some-place to be, and we have only a person to be with, which is not quite as warm and fuzzy as it sounds. their days are pressed and starched and will revolve around a familiar face with anxious, twisting hands. they seem to pinch it at the temples, they are obsessed with washing in a regular, cyclical motion, always forward; they are on clock. we are not. I don&#39;t know what we are, really. I know we slept together last night, and in the morning we sat on some couch in a series of couches (stuffing leaking from bullet-holes, torn leather, wayward springs protruding like broken ribs) smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee, watching time half consciously piss itself away with half shut eyes. </span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c2">there&#39;s something else I haven&#39;t really mentioned, which is that I&#39;m a writer, or at least supposed to be. that means I&#39;m meant to take moments of instability and chaos and extract from them, like uncooperative teeth, such things as structure, meaning, or the wilting emotions a broadsheet journalist might call &quot;perennial&quot; between sips of a macchiato. people read blurbs like the back of wine bottles, and the true sentiments of intention float to the bottom of the glass like sediment, and</span></p><p class="c43 c226"><span class="c2">are forgotten. I&#39;d like to mention here, as it&#39;s sort of relevant, that I don&#39;t really read, I don&#39;t do much writing. and that in all those moments when we lay together staring up at the smoke from our fags, I felt nothing at all, because for us it was an evacuation and an emptiness. I invite the valentines pedlars to fuck themselves, and buy their right hand an apologetic bouquet afterwards if they think that&#39;s what it is. I know what it is. that&#39;s why I don&#39;t talk about it, I keep schtum. like now, for instance. </span></p><p class="c145 c232"><span class="c2">she hands me a cigarette because I haven&#39;t spoken in a while and I&#39;ve been staring at someone&#39;s shoes. she thinks I&#39;m being pensive, or sullen, but in actual fact, the shoes are quite atrocious, and I&#39;m waiting for the person responsible to turn around so I can put an insult to a face. I explain this. she agrees without equivocation. there, now you can feel more comfortable sharing my general sense of disdain, seeing as it&#39;s not just me you&#39;re agreeing with. </span></p><p class="c141 c195"><span class="c2">she has to go do some shit with her hair, she says. I don&#39;t know for who, she won&#39;t tell me. I imagine a rich old bachelor who will pay page-boys to defile her in the billiard room, but don&#39;t mention this aloud, so as to preserve the composure of any nearby feminists. </span></p><p class="c141"><span class="c2">anyhow, </span></p><p class="c148"><span class="c2">it is that she needs some money for the hair, or whatever, so we go find an ATM. I figure I&#39;ll go see a film about how the world will end, to distract me from how the world is ending, and determine to extract cash in the pursuit of this aesthetic enterprise. </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c2">we&#39;re in the city now, we&#39;ve made it. I&#39;m fairly sure she&#39;s got around a tenner left, and I&#39;m not far off. we start walking. </span></p><p class="c9 c130"><span class="c2">while we walk, I talk to her about things, because I like the way she rounds ideas out, and how words sound when she says them. </span></p><p class="c145"><span class="c2">I start. </span></p><p class="c14 c33"><span class="c2">&quot;consider how few people can quote milton, and how many know the lyrics to &quot;china in your hand.&quot;&quot; </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c2">&quot;so you want to be the cindy lauper of poetry.&quot; </span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c2">&quot;why not?&quot; </span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c2">&quot;aye sound.&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c213"><span class="c2">&quot;you need the music thing. like, james brown wrote a song totally about his dick. and it&#39;s fire. I love that shit.&quot; </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c2">&quot;well maybe you should start writing poems about your dick then?&quot; </span></p><p class="c5 c194"><span class="c2">&quot;that wouldn&#39;t give me much to write about. I&#39;ll stick to myopic technophobia and a preoccupation with drug fuelled counter culture.&quot; </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c2">&quot;you can stop using my phone to play fucking mario kart then-&quot; </span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c2">and so on. her hair is blue and when she pouts, buildings in the street lean over to ask what the matter is. all I have to give her are words and, well, she&#39;s still here, for now. I just keep my eyes above the neck and try not to look at the warning signs on cigarette packets. I try not to read too much, or read into too much, too much at all, if that makes sense. I haven&#39;t done this in a while, you know. this used to be my evacuation and my emptiness, and that worked fine for a while, I suppose. but then I guess I got tired of talking to myself and wandered out into people to see if they had anything to say. turns out, unsurprisingly, that they did, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing with myself lately.</span></p><p class="c43 c95"><span class="c2">yet still, when people ask what I am - and though the answer is often bored and listless - I&#39;ll forgo the truth (frequently inebriated bar-tend) in favour of the more exotic alternative, &quot;writer,&quot; which has more to do with a future I haven&#39;t yet engraved in time, so much as sketched with crayons. in any case - &quot;writer?&quot;. writer, as token of a type, as distinguished from other people who write, besides the fact most everyone does, everyday. most aesthetically, through speech - but then their writing is a shadow of their speech, and their voice the dial that casts it. they scatter their writing to the wind. people who make it their job want the wind to stop for them, because they&#39;re so damn important. </span></p><p class="c9 c19"><span class="c2">look, some guy asked me what I do when I&#39;m not pretending to be normal, and so I said, &quot;writer.&quot; he said that was interesting, because he wasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t get it. I long to be a chartered accountant, with a wife who never fucks me and three kids who quietly plot my demise at the dinner table. not a </span><span class="c35">writer, </span><span class="c2">the least literary of all figures. working some bar, with unshined shoes and a pocket full of cocktail napkins bearing barely legible notes on subjects that, by the time I catalogue them, I no longer care about. here, take a look at one of them - </span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c35">much of the business of bar work is perpetuating the illusion that alcoholism be not only permissible, but desirable. </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c2">in fact, here&#39;s another one. don&#39;t pout, wait, it&#39;s pretty good - </span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c35">as far as hospitality goes - an oxymoron, when you account for the treatment of hospitality workers - well, if you can tie a double windsor knot while stoned, you&#39;ll probably make out fine. </span></p><p class="c9 c228"><span class="c2">in fact, fuck, sorry, last one. I like this one. don&#39;t worry about her by the way, she&#39;s busy looking at her phone - </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c35">my country&#39;s alcohol laws are relatively stringent, but its drinking culture is patently deleterious. to bastardise another, a nation&#39;s laws and its attitudes (the core of its behaviours) are often schizophrenically opposed. </span></p><p class="c90"><span class="c2">shit like that might sound relatively eloquent. and I mean, it is. but what does it have to do with the way my back aches when I sit down the wrong way, or why my bones go brittle in the winter? can you fuck an aphorism? can an aphorism park on your lap and take a ride? can you have any faith in </span></p><p class="c4 c211"><span class="c2">me at all, knowing that I wrote much of these things shortly before serving a half and half to an elderly gentleman with liver failure and a catheter bag? (his name is reggie. he&#39;s a regular with three grand-kids.) what if I elaborated, that I worked out the phrasing (chewing at the nib, eyes furrowed in an expression of youthful, yet knowing concern) while he filled it? the catheter bag, I mean. </span></p><p class="c141 c218"><span class="c2">&nbsp;- she has now screwed up her face in an expression of wanton petulance, which I find briefly arousing, though not enough to remark upon it, or stop talking to you - </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c2">writers essentialise, they want to reduce things to the naked element. ideally, they should save us from our solipsism and bring us back to other people. but sometimes it gets a bit fucking annoying being reminded that most of your thoughts are second hand, and that the ones which aren&#39;t probably aren&#39;t very good. anyway, I think they fall short of the truth on purpose, these writers, because they&#39;re scared that, after all is said, there&#39;ll be nothing left to say anymore, and no room for them. if they got too close to what it is, the truth might prove we&#39;re not truly here on purpose, that the words we speak are a distraction from the improbability of creation&#39;s intentionality. so we create ourselves,</span></p><p class="c20 c231"><span class="c2">and try to make god an image we can make ourselves out of. we made god as a template for ourselves, after all. </span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c2">but now I look around at her as she exhales a smoke ring and wonder how it took me so long to appreciate the benefits of not thinking so much about shit that doesn&#39;t matter. images vibe through me like burning photographs - various angles, the way her eyebrow twitched spasmodically, and then, like pulling a crucial thread, each muscle in her melted and laid down, and we slept. </span></p><p class="c9 c67"><span class="c2">nah mate, I&#39;ll just be over here, pretending I give a shit about finishing &quot;madame bovary,&quot; while those images will still be there, wordless, illiterate, and more compelling and complete that anything I have ever written, will ever say, or am exhorted to care about. time melts for me, I am apart while she pulls the sleeves she wears her pulse on over her wrists and says something I don&#39;t hear. barkers and town criers shout: four year degree; office job; do you have a dream. the weight of my dreams has dusted me clean and as I lie senseless on the mat, and some screaming blur counts down from ten, I laugh at images of fuck, while the streets burn and fools say I&#39;m meant to do something about it, when I don&#39;t give one either way. a televisual parade of pig head fuckers and shit hair-cuts who seem intent on interrupting each-other on live television, to say things they might second guess if they&#39;d ever had a job which tore a strip off them the way it does, say, a migrant on six pounds an hour, wiping pre-theatre shit off the bowl of the white-washed bourgeoisie dream. too much? too much. </span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c2">I&#39;m over-generous in all things, most especially those things in which one ought to be sparing. </span></p><p class="c14 c54"><span class="c2">we reach the arse to mouth. ATM, to adopt the american style. we are all victims of the american style now, and we&#39;ve walked past at least three kilt shops blaring traditional scottish music to prove it. who&#39;s left to dictate what is traditionally scottish, and who cares except people who aren&#39;t? if there is someone, aren&#39;t they sufficiently senile and estranged for sequestration to the rocky shetland crag they&#39;ve always dreamed of? may they live out the remainder of their years in the pleasant embrace of whisky whose flavour profile they never understood, with synthetically implanted memories of claymores and bandits wearing skirts. </span></p><p class="c9 c175"><span class="c2">I think that sounds pretty good, that little diatribe, but I don&#39;t say anything to her because she&#39;s talking about something important; a faint, humming trill which tenderises what remains of my mind into mince. she bends sound into memetic catch-phrases, I can see the lingua franca tempered and beaten into abstract shapes I&#39;m too old to understand - but she&#39;s here, for now. with a phone which is smarter and more ignorant than I will ever be, she takes a picture of herself pretending to cry, and writes something on it. I think I&#39;m in there in the background, somewhere. </span></p><p class="c101"><span class="c2">but aye, the old arse to mouth. there are two next to each-other, and we approach them much like a post-financial crisis couple might approach a pair of slot machines. this is because we are a post-financial crisis couple, approaching a pair of slot machines. </span></p><p class="c32 c117"><span class="c2">we set down our bags to examine the damage. turns out she&#39;s comparatively flush. a score and change. she kisses me and tucks a ten into my breast-pocket, and she&#39;s gone somewhere, before I can expound on the futility of an independence movement, the exigency of a return to community politics, the three unfinished manuscripts which I insist on reminding those who ask (no one asks) are on the cusp of completion, briefly postponed for the sake of some &quot;background reading&quot;. my education fails me as I watch her arse walking away. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">it&#39;s a very nice arse. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I&#39;d prefer to keep it around. </span></p><p class="c6 c142"><span class="c2">however, I submit to an ensuing absence of carnal entertainment, and concede to its apposite alternative; the movies. while I walk it is grey and silent and I think of things which distend my</span></p><p class="c20 c163"><span

class="c2">________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c241"><span class="c2">I walk out into late afternoon cigarette smoke, hot sugar smell, far off screaming. the unmistakable report of gun-fire. blink in the light after two hours in the dark. some movie. guns and androids and the end of days as we know it. I might remark upon the inventive use of cinematography in the closing scenes to imply an end to our noxious marriage to technology, and a restitution of our relationship with nature. if waxing poetic, I would add the intra-android caste system paralleled neatly with contemporary social inequality, as man-made as the synthetic alloy and circuit-boards therein. however, I don&#39;t wish to insult your intelligence, and I don&#39;t really buy any of that bullshit. suffice it to say, the spectacle sated certain vicarious appetites, and allowed more pressing appetites to go numb in the dark. </span></p><p class="c9 c83"><span class="c2">I might not buy it, the bullshit, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not somewhat enjoyable to talk it. we all walk through the same gallery, art music and films - it can be interesting what people attend to and what they make of it. though, even when I&#39;m most immersed in it, I can&#39;t forget the cost of the entry</span></p><p class="c20 c204"><span class="c2">fee, nor the quality of the overpriced coffee. over time I&#39;ve figured all these works of eschatology are just a moany cunt&#39;s way of eulogising the sun, instead of figuring how to keep it burning. I keep seeing and hearing from these moany cunts, who wear their opinions like a fashion statement and dispose of them as quickly. they&#39;re often the ones talking about how close we are to city walls falling. </span></p><p class="c9 c133"><span class="c2">there&#39;s no great need of a reminder there&#39;s dry rot in the woodwork, or that edinburgh castle is built on sand. although, it&#39;s a neat distraction from what it is. I can purchase a few neat beliefs; the exigency of nuclear disarmament, or the noxious environmental impact of avocado farming. write a thesis on a b-grade sci-fi. it changes, mainly, my bumper sticker, my shopping list, and the word count of my blog, so exclusive that its readership is limited to the few family members I haven&#39;t yet excluded through my lack of industry. by I, I don&#39;t mean me, I mean those other &quot;I do declare,&quot; aye aye captain freaks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">my implementation of first person is simply a rhetorical device, you understand. </span></p><p class="c50 c192"><span class="c2">these people can lament puppy farms or deforestation with the impassioned pathos of a family crisis. but in love they are cold and give nothing (they never &quot;go under,&quot; in the nietzschean sense, or otherwise). for them the flesh is something to be overcome. if they do look you in the eye, they do so out of courtesy, the eliding social value. they find it easier to save their hatreds for pre-theatre diatribe delivered in drunken, glib gibbers. they don&#39;t even have the decency to spit whilst smoking. and they can all remark intelligibly on the anti-vietnam subtext of james cameron&#39;s aliens, without having been there to see any of it. even their opinions are second hand, these upholsterers of the past. </span></p><p class="c9 c108"><span class="c2">not that I can recall the last time I saw one of these people in person, of course. but I know they&#39;re there, when I itch in winter, or when I experience an odd, unscheduled bout of neuralgia - one of them is nearby, hiding inside the skin of someone who appears human, but isn&#39;t - sipping starbucks coffee and writing in a chicly distressed notebook. they probably dot the &quot;i&quot;s with love-hearts, and if they could hear what I was thinking, they&#39;d turn me over to the murder squads. </span></p><p class="c141"><span class="c2">fuck it. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">it&#39;s cold. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">where&#39;s my hot water bottle? </span></p><p class="c5 c135"><span class="c2">I walk around and light one of my few remaining cigarettes and call her. nothing. she&#39;s either still getting her hair sheared or, you know. I shrug and inhale, putting the phone back into my pocket. around 30 seconds later I take the phone back out of my pocket, and look at pictures of cats. I don&#39;t even like cats. then again, I don&#39;t even like phones. we&#39;ve all got one though, so unless I wish to live a self-imposed exile from conversation with you all, I need one. funny how increasingly I seem to acquire things I need, but don&#39;t want, and question less and less. I&#39;m starting to sound like one of those moany cunts I enjoy decrying. I play some mario kart. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c2">time seems to be too much for us. we get quarter century crises now, rather than mid-life. we live too fast and get anxious we&#39;ve missed something, take pictures to shore up the gaps in our memory. for instance, I know a girl who&#39;s taking pictures all the time. she can&#39;t let a moment pass without commemorating it in a pose. she approaches her occupation with the loose professionalism of an old hand who takes his expertise for granted. she takes pictures from reality, removes frames like cards from a deck, and places them behind your ear, or in your pocket, such that you think - &quot;oh, I remember this one, how did you do that?&quot; you&#39;d think she was afraid of forgetting the sunset, the way she gambles with these face cards. but I guess when time is too much, it&#39;s more manageable to contain it inside a frame. we are all careful curators and custodians of time, now. and it is enough to be memetic, rather than suffer the gulag trying to rewrite the bible. I&#39;ve started taking photographs</span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c2">as well, I suppose, in my own way. I&#39;m no longer too concerned about smartness, but more with saying a thing you might catch over a boiling kettle, or a car back-firing, and think - </span></p><p class="c94"><span class="c2">&quot;aye.&quot; </span></p><p class="c50 c149"><span class="c2">I know another girl. she finds herself always in the frame with some celebrity, and seems to understand a law of pan-dimensional resonance which draws her to the right bar, at the right time. she is always in the vicinity of the mystery, or at a barely safe distance from the epicentre of tomorrow&#39;s headline. she&#39;s always gone before they can take a statement, and all that remains is her face peering from the top left balcony, in the back of the picture, watching it all. not that she&#39;d tell you any of this. once we wanted to be famous. now that it&#39;s so easy, we seem content to ironise it, and so the generation which idolised idolatry prefers to be adjacent to what&#39;s happening, rather than a part of it. remaining outside is now an inside joke. </span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c2">I check my phone again. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">my messages have been read. </span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c2">staring at them, however intently, fails to elicit a response from their recipient. I think of lonely old maids in castle keeps staring off into reveries of old shags, wondering why their man hadn&#39;t written them in months, and feel envious. they could at least pretend their letters hadn&#39;t been received. </span></p><p class="c109"><span class="c2">it&#39;s not just obsessiveness, but concern - the murder squads will be out soon, and so far as I know she left her .22 down the back of someone&#39;s couch. a good hair-cut is a weapon in the right hands, but a good hair-cut can only do so much. same way that a talent for textual analysis is fairly useless outside of a seminar, or the weed smoke infused living rooms of certain itinerant arts students. but I guess we talk shit because we can&#39;t say what we want, to precisely who we want. so in that spirit, let&#39;s talk. </span></p><p class="c110"><span class="c2">it wasn&#39;t always like this. that&#39;s always struck me as a profoundly redundant expression, given that nothing is ever like it always was, because it&#39;s always changing. but anyway, it wasn&#39;t. always like this, I mean. </span></p><p class="c206"><span class="c2">it began on halloween. I know, because there was a bloody hole in my chest where something important used to be. that, and all the decorations. I recall waiting for her in the attic room of the bar, before it started, and knowing even then I was about to commit to an inadvisable union. there was some song on in the background, something with strings which reminded me of bernard herrman, and as time bulged like wet floorboards in the anticipation of it all, there was only every man who&#39;d ever waited for a woman, woman for man, there was only and always the abeyance as you look up and see the guillotine suspended above, waiting to descend. and there were all the things we say to slow or speed this anticipation, all the games we play. every man and every woman in a procession, waiting for the blade. some of them holding hands along the way. then she arrived, and all of these thoughts descended upon her head and coloured her with subtext, like a sound that changes through a law of association. you worry that, after this descent, the person that they are is erased in favour of who you think they are, or need them to be. I&#39;ve found this to apply to more things than just the games which men and women play when they&#39;re alone. it&#39;s the beholder that&#39;s proven shallow in this, not the beheld. but in spite of all the mess, you seem to see hidden things you didn&#39;t notice before, after. at once, all the shite pop music I considered trite seemed imbued with hidden significance, like wise old men who once seemed drunk, but now seem to see things at the bottom of lake beds that young ones don&#39;t. </span></p><p class="c9 c214"><span class="c2">she brushed aside a paper skeleton hanging from the wall, and then other things. this was before the klaxons and all the rest with which we are now so acutely familiar.</span></p><p class="c43 c67 c237"><span class="c2">I would get up and do my exercise, shave. I would even brew coffee and stand at the window with a quietly contemplative look on my face. none of it did much good and I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling the world was about to end and I was the last to find out about it. she would hand me things and I would drink or smoke them. when I walked down the street my feet sank through the concrete and I walked in flames. you mightn&#39;t have noticed this, in between my cigarette, my polished boots, and all my petty justifications and appearances. we hid it from the bosses and the murder squads, and made out alright. we rarely value our own time until we&#39;ve agreed to let other people waste 50 hours of it a week, but I didn&#39;t question this - at the time. for although I could tie my tie and play the petty games of movers, none of it could distract me from the fact that I had beaten myself both black and blue and all the world I saw was a bruise. but in the spaces in between, it was always halloween. </span></p><p class="c141 c191"><span class="c2">then it wasn&#39;t and then came the batons. we seemed to wake up one day from a dreamless sleep to find that all the fairytale books were burnt to be replaced by laws of oiled and rolling cogs. </span></p><p class="c9 c151"><span class="c2">there was a team of alchemists out there, standing in their wizard cloaks at the head of conference tables, amongst the focus groupies, trying to determine the best method of perfecting the androgynous, android face. they chipped teeth out of enamel with zeal and biting tongues. the lips implied labia. the nose, aquiline and neat, promised a long life line and a facility for saying the right things at dinner parties. when it laughed it made a guttural, mechanical noise, but they could fix that in post, and we all know looks are more important than a voice. if it can shut up and look good then it&#39;s ready for a commercial break, for a billboard post. give it subtitles, suggest a personality it never had with a failed literature graduate&#39;s copy, who beavers eagerly in the basement of an ad firm without a name, with a boss without eyes, and with a face he might have the temerity to save someday if he could ever stand to look at it. </span></p><p class="c9 c208"><span class="c2">we watched the attractive yuppies they created on our televisions. they skydived through pastel coloured images of lsd reverie, while we wondered fitfully why we found it so difficult to lift off the ground. so we got high while we waited for someone to tell us. </span></p><p class="c98"><span class="c2">people stopped talking to each other, started walking down the street with end of days pickets. maybe that&#39;s all the end of days really is - the day when people stop talking to each other. all the beggars wore louis vuitton suits under their rags, and all the lawyers and the businessmen looked tired and haggard as they flicked c-notes into their pork pie hats. you had to walk fast because the streets were on fire, and now and again you&#39;d see someone, without formula or denotation, with a face that was a simple smile, tip-toe the white line between and never seem to catch alight - but you didn&#39;t see that very often. and all the murder squads were out in force, and they wore bright sashes round their arms so we&#39;d know. batons. smoke grenades. klaxons sounded from their vehicles, right next to the mounted guns, and they told us much the same they&#39;d always done, but we&#39;d stopped listening to them for so long that now they were up there with their lugers trained on our temples, and we were down here, looking up at them like nonplussed arthur dents, wondering where our swaddling towels had gone while we tried to climb out of the crib. fell back limp on our arses. </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c2">in the middle of this, was I expected to write things down? </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">well, aye. </span></p><p class="c5 c129"><span class="c2">something about pens and swords, fucked if I know. I was drunk when they started kicking doors in. I&#39;d have ducked in charlie&#39;s but he&#39;d fucked off up north, and there was no one left to grab even a half of whatever with, such was the dire nature of the situation. most shoegaze evenings would find me reminiscing over some failed romantic episode while pretending I was reading. in actuality I was swimming in the shallows between lines with a thick look on my face.</span></p><p class="c13 c42"><span class="c2">I wore black, she wore blue, they wore grey. flags and hopes hung upside down. regardless, revolution was afoot, and I figured I ought to do something, even if it did concern mainly myself. </span></p><p class="c67 c77"><span class="c2">I slept on a bed of nails and stuck pins through various extremities. wrapped myself in sheets of drywall and asbestos, consumed water which ran black from the tap. I ate dirt and retched and ate some more, and looked at a few photographs because there was nothing else I could think of, and remarkably, found this to be the worst. I buried myself upside down and had john wayne exhume me just to shoot my eyes out. I threw myself against walls and out of windows without notice, I jumped off bridges with typewriters tied to my feet and sank to the bottom. myself and all the other cunts who&#39;d royally fucked it formed an orderly line to hell, because it was the best place to get a drink at that time and, blessedly, nick cave was on the juke. I woke up in a pool of my own blood, filled a wine glass and painted the town with it. me and my sisters made molotovs and firebombed polling stations (don&#39;t worry, they were empty.) I plotted seditions, overthrew governments, destroyed local businesses. I watched the perverse, the incestuous, and the unworthy crawl from the base of burning buildings, with a lighter in my hand and a can of gasoline at my feet, while their old ladies pawed my shoulder and told me how pretty I looked, in that light. I looked into the eyes of strangers and didn&#39;t find much there, so I repeated what I&#39;d done so far, added some broken glass and barbed wire and other caustic materials, drank burning acid, burnt off my fingertips with bunsen burners. I engaged in acts of chimerical alchemy, I turned my piss into wine and my shit into gold, and burnt my formulas so no one would know how. I screamed it was alive, and once it was, I killed it, and had a fag, because I knew how that story ended and I wasn&#39;t so naive as I had been. when it was over, and I was empty, tired, and heartbroken in a barbour jacket - well, I was alright mate, to be honest. I looked pretty cool, and I was ready to fuck everything up again. the further we fall from heaven, the less we care to lose it. </span></p><p class="c9 c25"><span class="c2">I wandered off into the sunset, my dogs and I. took the tonsure. divested myself of worldly things such as hair, or self respect. I attempted to be a bit less of a cunt. this has revealed itself to be a lifelong enterprise. but nevertheless, I&#39;m back here now, in the city, with a phone telling me how many people want to fuck me in a five mile radius (not that it&#39;s many), and someone else&#39;s name on my clothes. I want my voice to be heard, and so I must throw it in with other people&#39;s. I guess that this is the cost of it - screaming amidst white noise. and after scooping up the lost and the heartbroken from the valleys to the alleyways, I&#39;m fixing to get the band back together. for though yes, it did indeed rain, I must be the man, after all. </span></p><p class="c168"><span class="c2">I hear a noise which means my text has been responded to. I wait until the cigarette is finished before I look at it. apparently she wants to talk. when people get an itch to talk out of the blue, it&#39;s usually to say something no-one wants to hear. she sends her location so that the murder squads, the intelligence services, and I can see it. I make a move in the hope I&#39;m the first to get there, thinking that I must, fo sho, not be the first to ask &ndash; to whom should I, do I, address myself? </span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c18">the question, or (a resum&eacute;) </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">no great thing lasts more than an hour </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">without becoming something else. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I&#39;ve bumped enough shit to know that. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">nothing eternal in the matchbox besides its ubiquity. </span></p><p class="c124"><span class="c2">always another cockroach </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">always the same matchbox </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">always another great escape</span></p><p class="c182"><span class="c2">always the brief relief as it peeks out into the </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">same air outside as there was inside. same shit different angle. </span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c2">a fly can live and die in a day </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and we get around eighty years </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">about the same ecstasy and fury and relentless dare and tragedy </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">as a fly </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but ours gets spread over eighty years, give or take (diet dependent). </span></p><p class="c14 c52"><span class="c2">same as both the toff yaks and the yobos end up in the same macdonalds come 4am on a saturday, well, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">there&#39;s little evidence we end up any place different to a fly. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">no window seat. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">no complimentary drink. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">a pitch black stowaway ride in luggage. </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">perhaps a breath-mint and all, but they only give you one when they&#39;re trying to tell you something. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">why then, </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">on a day </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">when I have felt neither the joy </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">the fury </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">the relentless dare </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">or the tragedy </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">of a fly </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">am I concerned over an obscure pain in my right testicle? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">a voice tells me I ought to be concerned. </span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c2">all those voices could make a man mad </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and most of them aren&#39;t even mine. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I mean, </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I&#39;m no world eater. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I court no grand fruition. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but there must be someplace quiet. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I think of a place where I might watch horses play in

</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">very loud. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">maybe there&#39;s as little peace there as there is anywhere. </span></p><p class="c8"><span

class="c2">and lost it to the morning </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and can&#39;t say that I am any longer. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c2">I&#39;ve known enough people who felt the same </span></p><p class="c8 c227"><span class="c2">and observed the face the world made when they claimed themselves exempt from laws of chit chat </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">labour

class="c5"><span class="c2">whereas</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c2">at least I can be sure that you&#39;re reading this now </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">can&#39;t I? </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">my last poem. </span></p><p class="c170"><span class="c2">________________________________________________________________________________ </span></p><p class="c92"><span class="c2">now her hair is red, and she says she&#39;s leaving. I might have seen it coming if I&#39;d been looking at it. but of course the streets are on fire, and I&#39;ve been busy trying to tightrope walk the white line between. you never know if it&#39;s something you said or something you didn&#39;t say, but you know when the silence comes it&#39;s done. I no longer have the right to say through silence what I&#39;d like to with words - besides which, I have spoken far too much with both, it seems. and so she keeps walking. I follow. she&#39;s leaving on the next bus, and she deems it appropriate that I should escort her to the station, to ward off any marauding bandits or door to door salesmen. </span></p><p class="c155"><span class="c2">she asked me once why I bothered writing, when all I did was complain how little people read books. instead of saying something smart, like how people kept burning them, I let the question remain unanswered. I still haven&rsquo;t answered it, but when shit like this happens, when I&#39;m walking to a firing squad, or marching someone else to theirs, I get the itch to write it all down. I ask myself again. </span></p><p class="c9 c84"><span class="c2">writers are supposed to say things universally agreed upon, but agreed upon silently. they sort of spoil the joke of life to seem smart at parties. I&#39;ve never felt terribly smart at parties. and I guess that I&#39;ve never felt much like a writer. furthermore, in spite of this sacred duty to common denominators, I&#39;ve always felt unable to marry myself to these things we are meant, as world citizens, to deem important. I suppose it&#39;s kind of funny how that feeling should be felt by so many. they might read something, like this perhaps, and feel not quite so alone or helpless, they might pass me, alone and helpless, on the street. neither of us would know, and we&#39;d still feel alone and helpless, separately. that&#39;s the cold fact; that we hold up our ideas of how we might feel to escape how we do feel, and always will. </span></p><p class="c9 c111"><span class="c2">like, for instance, now, when all that is rational in me knows that this, whatever it was, has ended, and I&#39;ll return to beige normalcy and forget the piquancy of each moment with her. they&#39;ll be smoothed over and rewritten by memory. and even now, knowing this, doesn&#39;t change a thing. I am wilfully deceiving myself. </span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c2">I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that writers are liars. </span></p><p class="c6 c86"><span class="c2">whether they drink too much or fuck around, well, those things are questions of aesthetics. anytime someone thinks an empty epigram is important enough to be written down - they&#39;re lying. and furthermore, they&#39;re only writing because they&#39;re alone and there&#39;s nothing to wrap their dick around. pardon my being course, but it is what it is. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">why do you think I&#39;m writing this down now, rather than saying these things to her instead? </span></p><p class="c1 c240"><span class="c2">we duck into a close briefly, to avoid a patrol. it&#39;s beginning to get dark. I hand over her papers. she&#39;ll need them later. </span></p><p class="c9 c239"><span class="c2">supposedly a writer should be honest. but some of the worst things you&#39;ve ever heard were the most honest, and recited in the most objective of tones. planes crash. kittens die. why would you want to make a career breaking bad news to people, unless you sort of enjoyed ruining people&#39;s days? I suppose if your day&#39;s been ruined already, it&#39;s the next best thing to a good one - for both of us, you and I.</span></p><p class="c13 c63"><span class="c2">what does it matter to anyone but me that I&#39;ve walked through fire? should any of us have? and don&#39;t we always want the quiet life as surely as the cool girl from school, whose thrall we never truly escape from. and I am so high and drunk and removed, and now it all means nothing as a consequence. and never will. I don&#39;t have one spare fuck. I shall retain it, and save it for something worthwhile. all the books and the sidewalks burn. I loved you and you didn&#39;t, besides what I thought, and now I look, as for a text in a labryinthe library, half forgotten, for the mystery and the minotaur. </span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c2">ah fuck it. shoot the craw with the dog in the backyard. I must once again be the moving man. </span></p><p class="c150"><span class="c2">I can only hope that my sufferings do not become so particular I can no longer speak of them with other people. suffering is only particular to the suffering, however. it&#39;s a sort of law which binds us all together, and the anticipation of it, and preparation for its diminution, is a shared responsibility. we have all been on the bottom. we all know what it is to feel the whip. we are none of us the same, </span></p><p class="c23 c123"><span class="c2">but we are all of us equally susceptible to circumstance, to contingency, to the whip. if all of us can be beaten... we could try to be more careful, and more caring of one another. I&#39;m thinking of these things without speaking as she walks away and I follow behind her. if I am uncaring, I am at least a careful student of ironies. </span></p><p class="c9 c112"><span class="c2">mistakes like these are a young man&#39;s luxury. I look at old men and the way they sit in chairs and keep their voices to themselves, without moving. for a while I didn&#39;t understand their indolence, and now I know that whenever a man moves, or fixes to make one, trouble is on its way. trouble often carries something sharp, long, and heavy, and is not acquainted with prophylactics. despite this, I want to make a move, or say something, even if it&#39;s a second hand armchair idea that no one much cares for. </span></p><p class="c115"><span class="c2">but sometimes the only thing we can do for someone is say goodbye as they march into the meat grinder. I don&#39;t feel it right now, but I&#39;d like to believe that looking at this, as it happens, this terrible thing, is a preparation for saving the next one. but I don&#39;t know for sure, and I don&#39;t know for sure that writing these things down does she or I or whoever might come next, much good at all. I&#39;m free climbing the mystery with my eyes closed, no rope but threadbare, tenuous semantics, some cheap wordplay, a modicum of literary education. but most all of the black and blues, to show and tell. </span></p><p class="c9 c74"><span class="c2">it&#39;s got something to do with life and much to do with death when we realise the things we love most are people, and people are capable of buying a ticket and getting on a bus/plane/zeppelin, and leaving us forever. but it is often the looking, as they walk away, and the thinking as we try and draw them back to us through thought alone, (the thinking on what we might say, write, or perform to them) that is the making of us. our final consolation and reconciliation with the fact of our life is that it will end. </span></p><p class="c9 c66"><span class="c2">what is a writer or a poet if not someone who publicises their revelations, however modest they might be? and so what makes them any better than those whose revelations remain private? how do you place value on epiphany? and isn&#39;t epiphany cheapened by translation? isn&#39;t that moment when we look at what we love deepened, when it looks back and asks us, &quot;aye whit,&quot; and we reply, &quot;nothing,&quot; and smile? and if not, then what? I ask myself this question as I attempt to communicate the feeling, knowing it is in no language but in the tongue as it bends around another&rsquo;s. and isn&#39;t that, now, the only language I want to learn or practice? what do you want me to say, when I don&#39;t really want to say anything - but when saying things seems to be the only thing I can do? </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">we&#39;re at the station. </span></p><p class="c8 c217"><span class="c2">there&#39;s time for a cigarette, and the anxious search for the perfect goodbye words. I miraculously catch the scent of green, I see a schoolgirl put some trash in the bin instead of ditch it on the</span></p><p class="c43 c190"><span class="c2">pavement, and I am reminded of the insuperable nature of betterment, which moves slowly, aye, but moves surely. and my amazement is in how little of it has to do with what people read in books. books tend to complicate things which should remain simple. still she and I say nothing. </span></p><p class="c9 c47"><span class="c2">I prepare for the hour when the mind does not answer, and toughen up my leather. I am the man that scoops up the tired and the weary where they lie. I have a fashionable pair of shoes and a bottle of micellar cleansing solution. I think of buildings burning and the calm objectivity of rifles, while she is climbing the stairs onto the bus. her right lace is untied. she waves and I would like to mention it to her, but sometimes silence is better. I think I will die of embarrassment if the last thing I say to her is that she can&#39;t tie her own shoes, so I just wave back. </span></p><p class="c9 c29"><span class="c2">it would be reassuringly appropriate to say I will hop on the next greyhound to nowhere, or even move a few feet to my left. instead I will stand where I am and most likely will remain for some time, smiling, and thinking of noose arms around necks. the bus is gone. I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s going. </span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c2">in the meantime, it is october, I still don&#39;t have a place to sleep, and the world is still ending. I stand and smoke, and think a while. I&#39;m still supposed to be writing that thing, you know. perhaps I will. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">perhaps. </span></p><p class="c45 c171"><span class="c18">voices </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">you see what happens when a body grows out of its skin </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and the mind twists like espalier round what&#39;s left of the bones </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and escapes </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">while what is left of appearance and dignity </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">is left behind </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and withers. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c2">I think of the faces that made me and how they age </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and what they&#39;ll look like when time has taken hold of them </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">not yet </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">we prepare for these things by looking at them as they walk away </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">knowing they&#39;ll come back again to meet us sometime </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and not being afraid of things which will fall to the ground </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">or things which will grow in their place, </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">tomorrow </span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c2">just because we won&#39;t be there to see them. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">Time, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">face down in the dirt </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">broken bones what </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">horrors </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">what horrors have you seen? </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">while you&#39;ve watched us run around and into each-other </span></p><p class="c12 c75"><span class="c2">we did things which defied comprehension or decency, finding ways to justify it as a step in a staircase leading to, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">well.</span></p><p class="c99"><span class="c2">I think </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">perhaps </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">you were watching </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but thinking the same thing as I was </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">when I looked at a body swiftly withering </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and thinking that root </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">is my root </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and my mother&#39;s root </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">watching time walk slowly away </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">knowing it will come back again </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">with time. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c2">I&#39;d seen everything I was going to by the time I could talk </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but I just understand it a little better as I walk away from it </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">knowing it grows behind me like a maw growing tired in the corner </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">a face with opening hands never closing </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">which will one day open up and swallow me. </span></p><p class="c5 c236"><span class="c2">knowing that can make me feel ridiculous when discussing such things as the quantity of sugar in my coffee </span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c2">and indeed </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">how may I save the world when walking across a room feels ridiculous? </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">if not by laughing at it - </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">meantime, </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">we can talk, </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">can&#39;t we? </span></p><p class="c8 c137"><span class="c2">and throw our voices round the walls of this natal room while the sun touches its fag end to the dry grass and the mountains split and streets melt into hot black tarmac, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">we might tip-toe over division lines </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and laugh. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">you listen to someone snore </span></p><p class="c6 c177"><span class="c2">and think of the sure movement of machinery and the sound each metallic hand makes as it washes another </span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c2">and how through the same portals came thoughts and speech and poetry </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and how sometimes the speak people make is a sort of attenuated snore </span></p><p class="c6 c48"><span class="c2">and how other times it sounds more like singing in a bar past closing time and is light through an amber bar, bars all lined up </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">you listen to the different sounds we all make </span></p><p class="c8 c215"><span class="c2">how one from one place and one from another may bend it in a way which has attracted a certain connotation of </span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c2">affluence </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">poverty </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">the masculine </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">the feminine </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">intelligence or </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">ignorance. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">would I be utopian in suggesting that the impulse is all much the same </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">to bend the air that fills our heads into a grasping and a gesture and a meaning,</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c2">an offering of the air

one another as we try to be the same and lay claim to one another, </span></p><p class="c4 c100"><span class="c2">or a patch of land, a picket fence, a nook carved into the wall of bricks in which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">we might converse. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">we forget we all try to bend air </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">vainly and with a certain vanity </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and more often than not </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">bend to the wind like vanes </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">while we try. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">language is a matchbox and a marriage to everyone who speaks </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">from which there is no divorce </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">perhaps an estrangement or a separation </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but no severance. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">we all pay our due to it.

class="c15"><span class="c2">I cannot drink it away </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">it&#39;s in the water. </span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c2">and what of talk and telling tales then, right? </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">should I be judged for what I am, or what I try to be? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and if I am then, what if what I try to be is what I am? </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">if I am my action, what of all the actions which fail </span></p><p class="c8 c222"><span class="c2">and all the things we say which are misconstrued and

to start is to quit his chat </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">to silence him or </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">give him words to use which he doesn&#39;t understand or </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">tell him you don&#39;t understand his words </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">because they sound a little </span></p><p class="c6"><span

class="c6"><span class="c2">foreign or </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">well </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I suppose you get my meaning and </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">dig the lick of air I bent into this cheap sentence. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">how may we reconcile </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and quit talking shit talking if not by </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">talking shit and shooting bull </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">who </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">are </span></p><p

and dance </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and misconstrue one another again </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">sure but </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">we can speak with one another after </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">can&#39;t we? </span></p><p class="c170"><span class="c2">________________________________________________________________________________ </span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c18">p.s., may you never read this </span></p><p class="c76"><span class="c2">I might list all of the things you said to me </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">which struck me as beautiful </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but to list them like a litany would be profane </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and in doing so I would rob them of their poetry </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and make them prosaic again </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">so I wont. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">when things or people </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">careen too fast together </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">they tend to glance off one another like bullets </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and so now </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">as once before </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and most likely as I will again </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I am sat here with a cigarette whose taste I detest </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and with beer whose taste I relish </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">staring off at cigarette butts like they could tell me something </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">or </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">at the tops of roofs as I hang from out this window </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">pondering the magnitude to which I&#39;ve fucked things up again </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">between myself and other people. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c2">I can&#39;t make your voice speak through words </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">though </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">in saying that </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">words </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and my facility for them </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">are all I&#39;ve ever had </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">as I have had a facility for nothing else </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but I have hopes someday for the felicity to speak them </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">as if I were able to hear them being said outside my head </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">to respect my faculties as something worth upholding </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">rather than throwing them away </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">perhaps </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">to speak more carefully in the future</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">than I&#39;ve done of late. </span></p><p class="c5 c169"><span class="c2">then I might avoid being imprisoned by run-on sentences which are as telling as a rap sheet. </span></p><p class="c141 c193"><span class="c2">I made of you a consolation for all the petty voices I felt forced to listen to and sank into the noise of your voice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">this isn&#39;t to suggest I wasn&#39;t listening to it </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but </span></p><p class="c6 c157"><span class="c2">there is a comfort in noise when it cuts through loudness and addresses itself to no one but to one. </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c2">that I would have killed them all and thrown their ashes at your feet isn&#39;t poetry, in the end, </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">but a poetic weakness. </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c2">but when I said I loved you </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I meant it </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and mean it now </span></p><p class="c10 c138"><span class="c2">as I think this and write this down in lieu of saying it to you because you aren&#39;t here. </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c2">it&#39;s no pleasure to be reminded how childish you are </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">then have the blanket pulled beneath your feet </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and it goes to show how unprepared I was for you </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">that my voice found new breaks I hadn&#39;t known </span></p><p class="c8 c136"><span class="c2">when I told you what it meant to hear yours tell me who I am. it&#39;s no consolation, now, for me to know </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">that the distance between that who-I-am you spoke </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and who I am when I&#39;m alone </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">was too great to be a comfort to you. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">certainly, not at this particular moment; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">recall that I hang from an open window </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">attempting not to be dislodged. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">though there isn&#39;t a better time to be honest </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and honestly </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">when you subtract you from me </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">there isn&#39;t much left for me to look at </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">that doesn&#39;t make me blush from foolishness. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but then </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">even the most steady of us are in wait for </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">(if not entitled to) </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">a fall from grace which surprises even us. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">your voice sounds always different in your head. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">am I too late to outrun the sound it&#39;s made </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and apologise on its behalf for what it&#39;s done </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">or failed to do </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">for you </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">to you </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">or in your name? </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">or indeed, what it&#39;s done to the voices I quit listening to </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">while I was busy lost in yours.</span></p><p class="c99"><span class="c2">I realise that it&#39;s cold and shut the window behind me. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">often we&#39;re saved from impulse by habit. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I stub the fag </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and drink the drink </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and write this down instead. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">I have loved you without words </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">that&#39;s why I used them to write this to you </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">in the hope you&#39;ll never read this. </span></p><p class="c60 c139"><span class="c2">I met you in the middle of writing something I thought was important and then all importance vanished as surely as my words. </span></p><p class="c4 c144"><span class="c2">and I guess the reason I&#39;ve always had so much trouble finishing these things is because I always hate to end them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">you attenuated each idea I&#39;d held </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and for a minute or so </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">there seemed to be no end to anything </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">so long as you were nearby </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and I could say, </span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c2">&quot;alright love,&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and you could reply by smiling </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and saying nothing. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">maybe the day I learn to do the same </span></p><p class="c6 c96"><span class="c2">will be the day I&#39;m grown enough to say something worthwhile to other people and so, of all the things I have to thank you for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">the finest was silence. </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c2">but </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">no, I know I&#39;ve talked too long now </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">but, well </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">while I would like to feel self satisfied in solitude </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">you&#39;ve brought me closer to everyone I will ever meet </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and because of you </span></p><p class="c5 c203"><span class="c2">I&#39;ll most likely continue to close open windows behind me and run to other people which after all </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">is all there is </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">and the more I think of you </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">the more I&#39;m reminded of them and what they have to tell me </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">which in the end is something better than a consolation </span></p><p class="c8 c197"><span class="c2">but a reason for me to stick around wherever things are brutal, bloody, and beautiful. goodbye.</span></p></body></html>
